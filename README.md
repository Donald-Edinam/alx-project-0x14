## API Overview
The MoviesDatabase API provides access to a vast collection of movie data, including details about movies, actors, directors, and genres. It allows users to search for movies, retrieve detailed information, and explore related content.

## Version
The current version of the MoviesDatabase API is v1.0.

## Available Endpoints
- **GET /movies**: Retrieve a list of movies.
- **GET /movies/{id}**: Get detailed information about a specific movie.
- **GET /actors**: Retrieve a list of actors.
- **GET /actors/{id}**: Get detailed information about a specific actor.
- **GET /genres**: Retrieve a list of movie genres.

## Request and Response Format
### Request
A typical request to the MoviesDatabase API includes the endpoint URL and any necessary query parameters or path variables. For example:
```
GET /movies?title=Inception
```

### Response
The response is a JSON object containing the requested data. For example:
```json
{
    "id": "123",
    "title": "Inception",
    "director": "Christopher Nolan",
    "release_year": "2010",
    "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"]
}
```

## Authentication
To authenticate your requests, you need an API key. Include the API key in the request headers as follows:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Error Handling
Common error responses from the API include:
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed or API key is missing.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.

Handle these errors in your code by checking the response status and taking appropriate action.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
The MoviesDatabase API has a rate limit of 1000 requests per hour. To effectively use the API:
- Cache responses to reduce the number of requests.
- Handle errors gracefully and implement retry logic.
- Use pagination to manage large datasets.
